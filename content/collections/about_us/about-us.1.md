The Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources (MSWR), is a Ministry in the Infrastructure Sector under the Office of the Head of Civil Service. It was established in January, 2017 to act and play a major role in the national, regional and global effort to provide the needed support to the sanitation and water sectors. Until its establishment the water sector was part of the Ministry of Water Resources, Works and Housing and the sanitation sector was part of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development.

The goal of the Ministry is “to contribute to improvement in the living standards of Ghanaians through increased access to and use of safe water, sanitation and hygiene practices and sustainable management of water resources.”
